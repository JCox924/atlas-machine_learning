# CryoET OD
### Project Overview
CryoET OD is a project dedicated to performing three-dimensional (3D) object detection on Cryo Electron-Tomography (Cryo-ET) data. The goal is to combine machine learning techniques (specifically with TensorFlow) and domain-specific knowledge in Cryo-ET to detect and classify macromolecular structures in tomograms. This repository hosts the code, documentation, and resources to replicate and extend the approach.

## Features

3D Object Detection: Customized object detection pipelines adapted for volumetric data.
Modular Codebase: Clear separation of data loading, model definition, and training scripts.
TensorFlow Integration: Implements the latest TensorFlow (see TensorFlow Docs) for high-performance deep learning.
Extensible Framework: Easily incorporate new architectures or optimization routines.
Installation
Follow these steps to install and set up the environment.

### Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JCox924/atlas-machine_learning/personal_projects/CryoET_obj_id.git
cd CryoET_obj_id
```
### Create and activate a Python 3.10 environment (using conda):

```bash
conda create --name cryoet-od python=3.10 -y
conda activate cryoet-od
```
### Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Verify installation:

```bash
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)"
```

Ensure that TensorFlow is installed correctly and that the version matches project requirements.

## Usage

### Data Preparation:

Organize your tomograms in a designated data/ folder.
Update the data paths in config.yaml or similar configuration files.
Training:

```bash
python train.py --config config.yaml
```
This command initiates the training loop for 3D object detection.
Adjust hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size) in the configuration file.
### Evaluation:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model checkpoints/best_model.h5 --data data/val
```
This evaluates the model performance on validation or test sets.
View metrics such as precision, recall, and 3D Intersection over Union (IoU).

### Inference:

```bash
python infer.py --model checkpoints/final_model.h5 --data data/test
```
Generates predictions (bounding boxes or masks) for 3D structures in tomograms.
